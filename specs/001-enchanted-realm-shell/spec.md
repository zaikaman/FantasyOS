# Feature Specification: Enchanted Realm Shell

**Feature Branch**: `001-enchanted-realm-shell`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A full-screen fantasy desktop: Mossy background with glowing runes for icons (e.g., 'Mana Calculator' app launches a floating orb for math spells). Drag windows (parchment-style) to multitask—AI generates 'quest notifications' in a sidebar tavern bar. 'File system' as a treasure chest explorer using IndexedDB for saving doodles or notes. OS Vibes: Window management, app launcher, persistent state—like a Linux DE but with fireflies and lore popups."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Launch Fantasy Desktop Environment (Priority: P1)

A user opens the Enchanted Realm Shell and immediately sees a full-screen fantasy-themed desktop with a mossy background, animated fireflies, and glowing rune icons representing available applications.

**Why this priority**: This is the core experience and entry point. Without the desktop environment launching successfully, no other features can be used. It establishes the visual identity and immersive atmosphere.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the application URL and verifying the fantasy desktop renders with background, icons, and animations. Delivers immediate visual value and atmosphere.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the Enchanted Realm Shell URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** a full-screen mossy background with animated fireflies appears
2. **Given** the desktop has loaded, **When** the user views the screen, **Then** glowing rune icons are visible representing at least 3 default apps (e.g., Mana Calculator, Treasure Chest Explorer, Quest Log)
3. **Given** the desktop environment is displayed, **When** the user hovers over a rune icon, **Then** the icon glows brighter and displays a tooltip with the app name in fantasy-style text
4. **Given** the user is on the desktop, **When** they click a rune icon, **Then** the corresponding application launches in a parchment-style floating window

### User Story 2 - Manage Parchment Windows (Priority: P1)

A user opens multiple applications simultaneously and arranges them on the desktop by dragging, resizing, minimizing, and closing parchment-style windows to organize their workspace.

**Why this priority**: Window management is fundamental OS functionality. Users need to multitask between applications effectively. This is core to the "Linux DE" experience mentioned in requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by launching 2-3 applications and verifying drag, resize, minimize, maximize, and close operations work correctly. Delivers essential desktop environment functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** one or more applications are open, **When** the user drags a window by its title bar, **Then** the window moves smoothly following the cursor
2. **Given** a window is displayed, **When** the user drags a corner or edge, **Then** the window resizes while maintaining its parchment aesthetic
3. **Given** multiple windows are open, **When** the user clicks on a background window, **Then** that window comes to the front (z-index priority)
4. **Given** a window is open, **When** the user clicks the minimize rune, **Then** the window minimizes to the tavern sidebar (quest bar)
5. **Given** a window is open, **When** the user clicks the close rune, **Then** the window closes with a magical fade-out animation
6. **Given** a minimized window exists in the tavern sidebar, **When** the user clicks its icon, **Then** the window restores to its previous position and size

---

### User Story 3 - Explore Treasure Chest File System (Priority: P2)

A user opens the Treasure Chest Explorer application to browse, create, edit, and delete files (doodles, notes) stored persistently in IndexedDB, presented as items within a magical treasure chest.

**Why this priority**: File persistence is essential for productivity and data retention, but the desktop environment and window management must work first. This enables users to save and retrieve their creative work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening Treasure Chest Explorer, creating a note or doodle, closing the app/browser, reopening, and verifying the data persists. Delivers core storage functionality independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens Treasure Chest Explorer, **When** the application window appears, **Then** stored files are displayed as magical items (scrolls for notes, enchanted canvases for doodles) inside a chest interface
2. **Given** the Treasure Chest is open, **When** the user clicks "Create New Scroll" (note), **Then** a new note editor opens with parchment-style textarea
3. **Given** a note editor is open, **When** the user types content and clicks "Seal Scroll" (save), **Then** the note is saved to IndexedDB and appears in the treasure chest
4. **Given** the user has stored files, **When** they close the browser and reopen Enchanted Realm Shell, **Then** all previously saved files appear in the Treasure Chest Explorer
5. **Given** a file is selected in the treasure chest, **When** the user clicks "Destroy" (delete), **Then** a confirmation popup appears with fantasy flavor text, and upon confirmation, the file is removed from IndexedDB
6. **Given** the user creates a doodle, **When** they draw on the canvas and click "Store Artifact" (save), **Then** the doodle is saved as image data in IndexedDB

### User Story 4 - Receive AI Quest Notifications (Priority: P3)

A user receives periodic AI-generated "quest notifications" in the tavern sidebar that provide contextual messages, tips, or flavor text related to their current activities in the Enchanted Realm Shell.

**Why this priority**: This is an enhancement feature that adds personality and engagement but isn't required for core functionality. It can be implemented after the base desktop environment is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing various actions (opening apps, saving files, spending time idle) and verifying that contextual AI-generated notifications appear in the tavern sidebar. Delivers entertainment and engagement value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the desktop has been idle for 2 minutes, **When** the timer triggers, **Then** an AI-generated "quest notification" appears in the tavern sidebar with fantasy-themed flavor text
2. **Given** the user completes an action (saves a file, opens an app), **When** the action is detected, **Then** the AI generates a contextual notification (e.g., "You've stored an ancient scroll in your treasure vault!")
3. **Given** a notification appears in the tavern sidebar, **When** the user clicks it, **Then** the notification expands to show full text with a dismissal option
4. **Given** the user dismisses a notification, **When** they click the dismiss rune, **Then** the notification fades away with magical particle effects
5. **Given** multiple notifications accumulate, **When** the tavern sidebar becomes full, **Then** older notifications are automatically archived or condensed

---

### User Story 5 - Use Mana Calculator Application (Priority: P2)

A user launches the Mana Calculator app which appears as a floating magical orb interface for performing mathematical calculations with fantasy-themed presentation.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the app launcher ecosystem working with a concrete example. It's more important than AI notifications but less critical than core window management and file storage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking the Mana Calculator rune icon, entering mathematical operations, and verifying calculations display correctly in the orb interface. Delivers a functional application example.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the desktop is displayed, **When** the user clicks the "Mana Calculator" rune icon, **Then** a floating orb window opens with a calculator interface styled as a magical crystal ball
2. **Given** the Mana Calculator is open, **When** the user clicks number and operation runes (buttons), **Then** the calculation appears in glowing runes within the orb
3. **Given** a calculation is entered, **When** the user clicks the "Cast" (equals) button, **Then** the result appears with a magical glow animation
4. **Given** the calculator is performing an operation, **When** an error occurs (division by zero), **Then** the orb displays a fantasy-themed error message (e.g., "The mana flows are unstable!")
5. **Given** the Mana Calculator window is open, **When** the user applies window management operations (drag, resize, minimize), **Then** all window operations work as expected while maintaining the orb aesthetic

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user opens 20+ windows simultaneously? System should limit active windows or provide visual feedback about performance degradation
- How does the system handle very large files (>10MB) in IndexedDB? Should display storage quota warnings and prevent saves that exceed browser limits
- What happens when IndexedDB is unavailable or blocked? System should gracefully degrade with a notification explaining persistent storage is disabled
- How does the desktop respond on mobile devices or small screens? Should adapt layout with responsive design or display a message recommending desktop usage
- What happens when AI quest notification generation fails (API error, rate limit)? System should fall back to pre-written notification templates
- How does the system handle rapid window dragging/resizing? Should throttle or debounce operations to maintain smooth performance
- What happens if a user leaves multiple windows open and refreshes the browser? Should attempt to restore window states from session storage or localStorage
