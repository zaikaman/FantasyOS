# Specification Quality Checklist: Enchanted Realm Shell

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation items complete

**Validation Notes**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-centric language focusing on the fantasy desktop experience. No technical implementation details (frameworks, databases specifics, programming languages) are mentioned. Uses terms like "system MUST" rather than "code should."

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 25 functional requirements are testable with clear actions and expected outcomes. Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds load time, 30+ FPS, 500ms save time, 90 seconds workflow completion). No clarification markers needed - all ambiguous aspects were resolved with reasonable defaults (e.g., IndexedDB for storage, basic window operations defined clearly).

3. **Edge Cases**: Seven comprehensive edge cases identified covering performance limits (20+ windows), storage constraints (large files, quota), browser compatibility (IndexedDB unavailable), responsive design (mobile/small screens), error handling (AI API failures), performance optimization (rapid operations), and state persistence (browser refresh).

4. **User Scenarios**: Five user stories prioritized from P1 (core desktop and window management) to P3 (AI notifications enhancement). Each story is independently testable and delivers standalone value. Clear acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.

5. **Success Criteria**: All 12 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Examples:
   - Uses time-based metrics (2 seconds, 500ms, 90 seconds)
   - Performance metrics (30+ FPS, 100% data integrity)
   - User-facing outcomes (95% completion rate, 80% user satisfaction)
   - Avoids implementation details (mentions "system" not "React components" or "JavaScript")

6. **Scope Boundaries**: Feature clearly defined as a fantasy-themed desktop environment with three core applications (Mana Calculator, Treasure Chest Explorer, Quest Log), window management, persistent storage, and AI notifications. Scope excludes: multi-user features, app store/marketplace, complex file formats beyond text/images, networking/collaboration features.

**Assumptions Documented**:
- IndexedDB chosen for persistent storage (browser-based, no server required)
- Desktop-first experience (responsive design as enhancement, not primary target)
- Single-user local experience (no authentication or collaboration)
- AI notifications use external API (graceful degradation to templates on failure)
- Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari - ES6+ features available)

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES - Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command

## Notes

The specification successfully avoids implementation details while remaining specific and testable. All success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes rather than internal system metrics. The fantasy theming is consistently maintained throughout requirements without prescribing specific visual design technologies.
